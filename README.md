# Dược Diệu Hân Official Store

A small project for my awesome mum - est 2024 - Youtube link for the process of developing this project:

## Purpose of this website:

This website’s main mission? To help my mum take her side business to the next level! It’s like her virtual shop window where you can check out her products, find a link to her e-commerce store to buy them, and get her contact details. It might look a bit like a gallery website, but it’s actually inspired by an unexpected mixed-up of W3Schools, Shopee, and Metruyen.me.

Oh, and yes, it’s all in Vietnamese—that’s most of my mum’s customers are middle-aged Vietnamese folks, and the goal was to make it super phone-friendly for them. As for me? I’m a rookie at web development and mostly focused on learning Swift, so this project is just me winging it for practice. If the code looks chaotic, consider it a feature, not a bug 😅

_Please excuse any errors or messy code in this repository, and thanks for your understanding._ 🙏
